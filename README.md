Actually, kumon (his tution) is still open, so he has to do kumon homework and the homework his mom and dad give him.

  He also sometimes play nintendo switch, PS4 (Placestation 4), Xbox 1 x, and belive it or not, he have all these games, but he does not play these videogames so often because he studies more than playing videogames. His favorite one is the PS4, my second favorite is the nintendo switch, and last, but least (no not in last, but not least because this videogame is the videogame he hates) Xbox 1 x. He hate his Xbox because it is so hard to control.

Here is a song he made
Whoever you are you could be my friend
I don't care if people say anything,
you just could be my friend
